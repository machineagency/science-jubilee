# Installation

To install `science-jubilee`:

- Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/machineagency/science-jubilee.git`
- We recommend using virtual environments to handle dependencies. See [here](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/#creating-a-virtual-environment) for more information on virtual environments. To do this:
  - Move into the new directory: `cd science-jubilee`
  - Create a virtual environment named `.venv`: `python3 -m venv .venv`
  - Activate the virtual environment: `source .venv/bin/activate`
  - You should now see `(.venv)` to the left of your command line prompt! (If you wish to leave the virtual environment, type `deactivate` from any directory)
- Make sure you're using the latest version of pip: `python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip`
- Install the `science_jubilee` package: `python3 -m pip install -e .`
- Installation complete! Whenever you try to run programs using `science_jubilee`, be sure to activate the virtual environment that you created.

## Jupyter Notebooks

To use `science_jubilee` from within Jupyter notebooks:

- If you do not already have JupyterLab installed, do so from outside of your virtual environment: `python3 -m pip install jupyterlab`.
- Activate the virtual environment where `science_jubilee` is installed.
- Add your virtual environment to Jupyter: `python3 -m ipykernel install --user --name=<your_kernel_name>`
- Launch JupyterLab: `jupyter lab`
- When creating notebooks, be sure to choose the kernel you just added!
