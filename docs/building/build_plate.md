## Magnetic Sheet Application

**Comment:** The magnetic sheet is only needed for 3d-printing applications. A typical Science Jubilee builder, who intends to use this as a motion platform for lab automation would typically **not** install the magnetic adhesive plate, and can therefore skip this step.

## Grounding Wire Fabrication

**Comment:** The grounding wire is only needed for the heated build plate, and thus a typical Science Jubilee builder, who intends to use this as motion platform for lab automation could skip this step.

## Heated Pad Wire Management 1/2

**Comment:** The typical Science Jubilee builder, who intends to use this for lab automation and did **not** order the heating pad can skip this and subsequent instructions.
