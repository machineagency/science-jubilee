## Parts with Heat Set Inserts

**Comment:**
- Feel free to skip this step for now, and to come back to perform these inserts as you need them. It is a fast process.
- If you purchased the machined [z-yokes](https://mandalaroseworks.com/products/jubilee-machined-yokes), then you will **not** use LBC-04, RBC-04, or BBC-04, and therefore you can skip steps involving these parts on this page.
- If you purchased the [machined front corner brackets](https://mandalaroseworks.com/products/jubilee-front-corner-brackets), then you will **not** use RCP & LCP, and therefore you can skip steps involving these parts on this page.
