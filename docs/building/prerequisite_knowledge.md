# Prerequisite Knowledge

Here are some useful how-to links, relevant to various assembly steps!

* [Working with Heat-Set Inserts via the ''Plate Press'' Technique](https://hackaday.com/2019/02/28/threading-3d-printed-parts-how-to-use-heat-set-inserts/)
* [Working with Inside Corner Brackets](https://jubilee3d.com/index.php?title=Working_with_Inside_Corner_Brackets)
* [How to crimp Molex Connectors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jcfD1UW8SE) --- you can skip this if you purchased the Filastruder kit, as all of the cables are pre-crimped.
* Tip: print this [Fastener Reference Sheet](https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=https://github.com/machineagency/jubilee/raw/main/frame/assembly_instructions/vitamin_reference_sheet.pdf) at 100% scale for an easy sanity check.
